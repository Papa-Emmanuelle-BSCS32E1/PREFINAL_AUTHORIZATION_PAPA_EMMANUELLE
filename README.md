Onion Architecture: (Yes/No)

Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

Answer: Yes

MVC Pattern: (Yes/No)

Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?

Answer: Yes

Web API: (Yes/No)

Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?

Answer: Yes (A little bit)

Application & Bottlenecks: Onion Architecture:

Benefits: (1-3 keywords)

Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

Answer: Based on what I know,

Modularity by dividing the application into layers
Clean code
High testability
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)

Answer: I spend a lot of time trying to resolve the error on which the endpoints do not appear as the login and register cannot be authenticated.

MVC:

Components: (1-3 keywords each)

Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.

Answer: Model is the data and business logic View is the presentation of said data Controller handles user requests, controls the flow of data between the Model and the View

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)

Answer: Yes, most of the challenge I encounter is because of me using the wrong logic and me not understanding how can I apply my vision.

Web API:

Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.

Answer: In my limited knowledge, MVC application is primarily used for UI while APIs are for connecting different software systems

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

Answer: Honestly No, I have little experience building MVC and APIs applications for me to encounter such bottlenecks. However, I'm having the interest to learn more about ASP.NET unfortunately, I'm lacking the motivation to be focused specially now that there are so many projects that needed to be done.
